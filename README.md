## Steviesaurus Dev 👋

Hi, I'm Steve. By day I write code, and by night I'm the develper at **Steviesaurus Dev**, creating retro inspired games.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting The Munching Millipede ready for release
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Commodore BASIC 2.0, again!
- 🤔 I’m thinking about my next project, getting Space Invaders in a place that will not cause issues when published.

You'll be able to play The Munching Millipede soon on [Steviesaurus Dev](https://steviesaurus-dev.itch.io/)
